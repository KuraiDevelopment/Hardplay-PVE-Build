* Blackmarket - Located in skalisty Island. Whats needs to be done:
- Setup all skalisty as dark night and toxic when ppl enter in the island. NVG not working this area or removed from types.
- Setup Parking area for vehicles (no helis)
- Setup Parking outside (before enter bridge) for helis and cars.
- Setup island mutant, grey NBC zombies and modded Bears spawn. (extra Health so ppl have to use special guns) * Special Gun its a custom AS50 (3500 dmg) and custom honeybadger(450 dmg), mobs need to be killed in 2 headshots or 3 body shots.
- Setup Bunker mutants, grey NBC zombies and modded Bears spawn inside. (extra Health so ppl have to use special guns) * Special Gun its a custom AS50 (3500 dmg) and custom honeybadger(450 dmg), mobs need to be killed in 2 headshots or 3 body shots.
- Setup access to the bunker by teleport.
- No Fly zone
- Setup traderplus vending machine inside:
  I pretend the Blackmarket to sell special ammo and mags for 2 special guns. 
  BM will pay good money for best guns from the mods. Normals guns if i sell in normal trader it pays like 3k to 6k in BM it will pay from 19k to 45k.
  PKP only can buy in BM and mags too. No spawn in map.
  BM will sell the all the helis in server, just not the Moskito that ppl can buy in vehicle trader.



  If i want to open another server with diferent map is there a way from ppl to transport gear or stuff to the other map? Cakefactory u could do that by puting stuff inside car and go to other map and take the car out from garage.

  P2P trader- Need to be done, couldnt find any in workshop. that i want. 
  What i want:
  Admin can setup a few members as p2p group.
  P2P member will have is own base where ppl go a make the requests for a price. (BM requests, world requests, any..like for example one heli)
  P2P Member can open or close the trader by world msg, for that he have to open the chat and with right privileges he will write "OpenP2P" or "CloseP2P". World msg will show for all players.
  A simple hud will show in every player if p2p is open or closed. One blue dot on top left corner of the screen of every player showing "P2P Open" or "P2P closed".
